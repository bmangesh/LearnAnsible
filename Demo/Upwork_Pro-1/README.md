Ansible Playbooks

Customer Requirment:

We are looking for someone who can create ansible playbooks to automatically deploy a laravel php platform, setup mariadb galera, php 7, nginx and make sure the servers are all backed up. 

We need a way to issue Letsencrypt ssl certs on one server and have the nginx config update and ssl certs moved to our other nodes. 

Any changes to our platform need to be pulled and compiled on our servers via a playbook. We use gitlab so we will need to be able to use that. 

We will also need a playbook to backup the servers to an offsite cloud backup service.
